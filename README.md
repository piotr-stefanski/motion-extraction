# Motion Extraction

## Motivation
Inspired by the Motion Extraction presented by Posy on his YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSS6yAMZF78)
I provided very easy Python code to reproduce Posy's results for everyone who would like to obtain similar effects on his recording.

## Quick start
1. Install python on your computer (I tested on 3.9.6 version)
2. Install dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the code `python main.py`
